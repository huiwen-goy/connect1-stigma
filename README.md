#### About this project
 
The goal of this project was to examine how social factors (especially fear about being stigmatized) predict a person's likelihood of obtaining hearing aids. 
 
#### About the data
 
The original dataset contained 4300+ survey responses. After I filtered the data by certain criteria, about 1000 survey responses were analyzed. Variables are found in the Questionnaire.md file. 
 
#### About the code
 
The cleaning.Rmd file contains code for the preparation of the original dataset, including: merging data from questionnaire responses, clinic measurements and consent forms; finding and excluding duplicated participants; finding and cleaning data transcription errors, and transforming responses into a format that was appropriate for numerical analyses.
 
The filters.Rmd file contains code for exploratory and statistical analyses.
