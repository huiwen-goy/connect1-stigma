**About this project**  
The goal of this project was to determine how well hearing, health and social factors predicted a person's decision to purchase hearing aids after a first visit to a hearing clinic.  

**About the data**  
The original dataset contained 4300+ survey responses. After cleaning the data and retaining only those with known age and sex, who were 50+ years old, and had never used a HA, there were 3312 responses left. Of these 3312 responses, 1396 were from participants who had a PTA of 25 or greater in their better ear (other choices of filtering criteria could be HHIE or self-rated ability). All 1396 participants had complete data for the outcome measure of hearing aid purchase, but only 753 participants had complete data across 28 predictors of interest. (If dropping item Q4 from the Age Stigma scale, then 756 participants have complete data.) The extent of missing data for the remaining 643 participants ranged from 3% to 53% of items per person.
