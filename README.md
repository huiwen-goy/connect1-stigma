#### About this project
 
The goal of this project was to examine how hearing, health and social factors (especially stigma) predict a person's likelihood of purchasing hearing aids after a first visit to a hearing clinic. 
 
#### About the data
 
The original dataset contained 4300+ survey responses. After cleaning the data and only including cases that had no missing data for 28 variables of interest and 1 outcome, there were 1869 responses left. The variables are listed in the Questionnaire.md file. 
 
#### About the code
 
The cleaning.Rmd file contains the code for cleaning the original dataset, including: merging data from questionnaire responses, clinic measurements and consent forms; finding and excluding duplicated participants; finding and cleaning data transcription errors, and transforming responses into a format that was appropriate for numerical analyses.
 
HTML files in the /doc folder show the distributions of three hearing measures and the results for four types of analyses. The links below will open the HTML files.
