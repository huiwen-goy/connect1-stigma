#### About this project
 
The goal of this project was to examine how well hearing, health and social factors predicted a person's decision to purchase hearing aids after a first visit to a hearing clinic. 
 
#### About the data
 
The original dataset contained 4300+ survey responses. After cleaning the data, there were 3312 responses left. Of these 3312 responses, 1396 were from participants who had a PTA of 25 or greater in their better ear. All 1396 responses had complete data for the outcome measure of hearing aid purchase, but only 753 responses had complete data across 28 predictors of interest.
