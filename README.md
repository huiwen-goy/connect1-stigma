# connect1-stigma

"Questionnaire.md" shows the list of questions answered by participants, and the corresponding variable names I created for each questions. The answers for some questions (such as Q1 to Q3) have been averaged to create just one variable (such as Sub_Age_avg). The "Listening Difficulty" responses were summed for each participant, as were the "HHIE" responses.   

"Connect1-stigma.Rmd" contains the full code for the analyses in the most current version of the manuscript. The output from this file is contained in the HTML version.

"Connect1-stigma-filters.Rmd" contains additional analyses, using different inclusion criteria for which participants qualify for hearing aids. The output from this file is contained in the HTML version. A summary of main findings is in the PDF file.
